# Cryptocurrency Paper Portfolio (CPP)

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## About the Cryptocurrency Paper Portfolio (CPP)

This Cryptocurrency Paper Portfolio allows users to simulate purchasing cryptocurrencies, tracking the coin prices, and computing their profits without actually conducting the trades.

## Logic and Features Behind the CPP

Users can add various currencies and their intended buy prices, which are then added to a Firestore Database. This database is pulled and displayed for users to view. Users can interact with the database by deleting specific coins in an aesthetically pleasing, user-friendly way. The CPP also pulls real-time market prices through an API, computing the userâ€™s profits based on the coins they purchased at the stated buy prices.
